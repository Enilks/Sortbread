# Sortbread
This project is just me learning about various sorting algorithms as well as how to code them. It's not very fancy, I'm just using it to play around. 

## Description
Currently, this program contains a small number of sorting algorithms, most of them of just your basic generic type. Sortbread has a basic menu, but everything is run through the terminal so it's not that amazing. There is a way to see statistics on stuff like the time it took to sort, how many swaps and comparisons took place, etc. 

<!--
## Getting Started
### Dependencies

* Bash

### Installing
* Download the MyFirstEldritchEvil.zip file from the release page, then extract its contents.
-->

### Running Sortbread
Just download the project file, then use your terminal to run the main method in the App class.

## Help
If you are having trouble getting this to work, make sure [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is installed. This is a somewhat buggy mess and may crash. Also, the only way to end the game is to die or press ctrl+c in the command prompt line.

## Acknowledgments
I used Wikipedia and Geeks for Geeks to learn how these algorithms work. Also thanks to ArrayV for being a resource to learn about and visualize the algorithms.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
